# SNP-RNA Protein Interactions for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 50 susceptibility loci showing robust evidence for association with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A striking fraction of these loci implicates RNA metabolism. Some loci code for RNA binding proteins (RBPs), which regulate RNA splicing. Other susceptibility loci contain polymorphisms that alter splicing of the gene or contain altered splicing patterns associated with AD. Overall, more than 90% of SNPs identified from GWAS occur in non-coding regions. Non-coding SNPs can appear in noncoding RNAs, introns, or in 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs). Our goal is to understand the effect of these non-coding or same-sense SNPs and their wide-ranging implications for understanding AD.
